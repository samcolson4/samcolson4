### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student in the September cohort of Makers Academy. Based in London, I used to be a corporate lobbyist before deciding to leave that role and persue something I really care about: software development. 

I am currently on the [Makers](https://makers.tech) course, where I have focussed on web development with Ruby using both the Rails and Sinatra framework. Some example projects can be seen on my profile.

If you're an employer, please take a look at my CV [here](https://github.com/samcolson4/CV).
