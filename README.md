### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student in the September cohort of Makers Academy. Based in London, I used to be a corporate lobbyist before deciding to leave that role and persue something I really care about: software development. 

I am currently on the [Makers](https://makers.tech) pre-course, and in my spare time I'm building a [personal website](https://github.com/samcolson4/colsondesign).
