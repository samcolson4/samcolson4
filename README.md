### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student in the September cohort of Makers Academy. Based in London, I used to be a corporate lobbyist before deciding to leave that role and persue something I really care about: software development. 

I have recently finished the [Makers](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp, where I focussed on web development with Ruby and JS using both the Rails and Sinatra frameworks. For my final project, I buult an iOS app for placing and viewing objects in Augmented Reality. A demo video can be found [!here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crr90faZCcw), and the repo is [here](https://github.com/samcolson4/signposts-again).

I am currently working on a second iOS app and finishing off my personal website.

If you're an employer, please take a look at my CV [here](https://github.com/samcolson4/CV).
