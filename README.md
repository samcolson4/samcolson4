### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a recent graduate of the Makers Bootcamp. Based in London, I used to be a corporate lobbyist before deciding to leave that role and persue something I really care about: software development. 

I have recently finished the [Makers](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp, where I focussed on web development with Ruby and JS using both the Rails and Sinatra frameworks. For my final project, I built an iOS app for placing and viewing entities in Augmented Reality, linking their GeoLocation to a map. A demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crr90faZCcw), and the repo is [here](https://github.com/samcolson4/signposts-again).

If you're an employer, please take a look at my CV [here](https://github.com/samcolson4/CV), or my [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/samcolson/).
